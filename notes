JS add Dynamic effects


ES: ECMAScript



SyntaxError: mistake in writing code

PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE:
1. Number: Floating point numbers --  Used for decimals and integers
2. String: Sequence of characters -- Used for text "" or ''
3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false -- Used for taking decisions 
4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (‘empty value’)
    a variable we declared but without assigning a value
5. Null: Also means ‘empty value’
6. Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed [Not useful for now]
7. BigInt (ES2020): Larger integers than the Number type can hold


JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of 
the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically
Value has type, NOT variable

let/const were introduced in ES6 -> mordern js
var -> old way of declaring variables

var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value. const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value. 

The difference between let and var is in the scope of the variables they create: Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they're defined. Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they're declared.


// 5 falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN
falsy values are values that are not exactly false, but will become false when we try to convert them into a boolean
console.log(Boolean({})); // true
